# READ ME 

## How to find everything 
Folders are named according to who should be handling the files (presenting vs. participating). 
The presentation itself is divided into chapters, hence sub-folders. 
The material is distributed according to where it belongs within the workshop and to be handled by whom. 
An introduction to this format (repository & usage for the worksop) can be found under the presenter's material.
