## DATA PROTECTION
 ## Protection of personal data
 • Compliance with legal data protection requirements
 • Identity protection, especially for sensitive/confidential topics 
• Protection of participants from commercial use of the data
 • Ethical and moral obligation
 • Archiving of personal data is only possible with the consent of the participants
 • Data without a personal reference are e.g., measurement data only. However, be careful 
with spatial references, which can also lead to persons in the legal sense!

 Lecture:- Personal and sensitive data- Informed consent- Anonymization, pseudonymization

 ###  Informed consent
 • Participants must be informed about what happens to their data
 • Participants must agree to participate based on this information
 • Data analysis and archiving require separate consents
 • Templates and checklists are available e. g: 
bildung.de/einwilligung
 https://www.forschungsdaten
• A frequent problem with archiving: no consent available
 • Strict wording in consent forms

###  Protection of personal data: How?
 Anonymization
 • Removal of all identifying information/details
 Pseudonymization
 • Replace sensitive information with a description that relates to the original context
 • Anonymity takes precedence over completeness/information
 • Replacing sensitive information with a pseudonym (code)
 • Example of anonymization tool: https://amnesia.openaire.eu/
