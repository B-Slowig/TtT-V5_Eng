 Task:- Call-out without notes- "When have you painfully missed order and/or structure in your data?"- Please shout out answers into the room

 ###  Ideas Out Loud
 • When have I ever sorely missed the order and/or 
structure of my data? 

## EFFECTS OF STRUCTURE 
###  Advantages
 • What was done, how and why remains comprehensible even years later
 • Other people can also work with the data
 • Duplication of work is avoided
 • Data loss is avoided
 ØWork can be done more efficiently

 ###  … of files and folders requires:
 • Meaningful names → no "fantasy names"
 • Uniform scheme
 • Logical structure
 • Date specification for chronological sorting in the following form: YYYYMMDD
 • Avoidance of spaces and special characters
 • Documented naming conventions or abbreviations used, e.g.,
 ➠[sediment]_[sample]_[Instrument]_[YYYYMMDD].csv 
➠[project]_[interview]_[location]_[person-ID]_[YYYYMMDD].mp4

 ## FILE VERSION CONTROL
 ### Best Practices
 • Store obsolete file versions separately after a backup, e.g., as a separate ID 
(v1.0.0)
 • Use of a version control table
 • Define responsibility for completion of files
 • Save milestone versions
 • If necessary, use version management software for large amounts of data
