 ## DATA PUBLICATION PATHS
 ### Three renowned options
 1. Supplement to a peer-reviewed article
 („enhanced publication“)
 2. Independent information object in a 
research data repository
 3. Data Journals

 ###  2. Independent information object in a research data repository
 • Discipline-specific repositories, e.g., Archiving BASIS 
(GESIS – Leibniz-Institut für Sozialwissenschaften), 
Pangaea
 Science)
 or TU Delft Repository 
(Data Publisher for Earth & Environmental 
• Institutional repositories, e.g., Refubium
 (TU Delft) 
(FU Berlin) 
• Interdisciplinary repositories, e.g., ZENODO

 ## PERSISTENT IDENTIFIERS
 ### Goals and types
 • Goal long-term findability
 • Avoid „dead“ links
 • Name changes 
• Digital Object Identifier (DOI)
 • Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID)

 Active:
 Lecture: Introduction to PID, Example of PID (DOI)

 ###  Digital Object Identifier (DOI)
 • DOI names are citable
 • Uniform standards and workflows guaranteed
 • ISO-Standard 26324

 ### Digital Object Identifier (DOI)
 • Unique sequence of alphanumeric characters:
 • Prefix (organization identifier) and 
• Suffix (object identifier)

 • Example:
 • 10.1234/abc123    - origin DOI
 • 10.1234/abc123.1 - DOI of e new version
 • 10.1234/abc123/2 - DOI of one part

 ###  Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID)
 • To clearly assign scientific papers
 • Estimation question:
 How many active members did 
ORCID have in 2022?

 Task:- Estimate the number of accounts by end of 2022- Slide 1: Question, slide 2: answer revealed- "What do you think: how many active accounts did ORCID have by the end of 
2022?"- Please type your estimate as a number in the chat- Wait, comment, then reveal the answer on slide 

 • To clearly assign scientific papers
 • 14 million active members (2022)
 • Register with ORCID 
(https://orcid.org/
 )

 ###  Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID) – Facts:
 • Operated by a non-profit initiative
 • Clear scientific identity
 • Lasts longer than an e-mail address
 • (Alpha-) numeric 16-digit code
 • ORCID registration takes approx. 30 seconds
 • Maintained by researchers themselves
 • Connection to Web of Science, Zenodo, DataCite, etc. 
• Used by journals, funders and institutions as authority file
