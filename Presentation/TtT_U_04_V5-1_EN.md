 Task:
 - Divide participants into 2 breakout rooms, one whiteboard per group.- Share the whiteboard with elements of the RD lifecycle.- "Please arrange the elements of the RD lifecycle on the whiteboard in a 
meaningful order. Add any missing elements if necessary."- BR time: 5 minutes- Presentation of results after BR by 1 participant from each group in plenary, 
maximum 1-2 minutes.- "Names of participants in both groups will be read out simultaneously. 
Please click on the correct group link BEFORE switching to breakout rooms."

# Research Data Management 
##  Research data management (RDM) …
 … includes all activities related to
 • processing
 • storage
 • archiving and
 • publication
 ... of research data.

  ... accompanies the research process 
from the initial planning to the 
archiving, subsequent use or deletion 
of the data.
