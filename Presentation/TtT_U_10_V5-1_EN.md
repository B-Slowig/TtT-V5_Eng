 ## ARCHIVING VS BACKUP
### Ideas Out Loud
 • How does archiving differ from backup?

 ###  Backup
 • (Automatic) backup of all
 data to prevent data loss 
(technically e.g., defective, or 
human error, e.g., accidental 
deletion)
 • All versions

 ###  Archiving
 • Backup of selected data for 
long-term storage
 • Final versions only
 • Integrity assurance
 • Long-term storage
 • Searchability

 ###  Requirements for long-term archives
 • Technical requirements
 • Seal for trustworthy long-term archives (e.g., CoreTrustSeal, 
nestor-seal, DIN 31644)
 • Costs
 • Making the data accessible
 • Longevity of the service provider
