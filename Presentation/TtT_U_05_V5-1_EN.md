 ## Publisher Policies 
 ### Example Springer Nature
 • Declaration of data availability required
 • Clear request to make underlying datasets publicly available. Certain types of 
data must be published (e.g., DNA sequence data)
 • Access for reviewers to the underlying data
 • If publication of the data is not possible (e.g., for data protection reasons), the 
availability must be stated in the manuscript together with the conditions for 
access
