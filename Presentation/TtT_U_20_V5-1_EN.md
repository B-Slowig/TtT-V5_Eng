 Moderation:- "We will soon switch back to the didactic framework. Are there any questions 
about the content before we proceed?"- Let Participants answer questions first, then the WL
 Passive:
 * Have responses ready for each section

 ## CONCEPT DEVELOPMENT
### Ideas Out Loud
 Some aspects of workshop concept development have 
already been addressed in the „formal framework“ 
section. 
• Which ones could be included?

## 8 STEPS
 ### Contents: What?
 • Open topic
 • Clarify conditions (DOT formula)
 • Set priorities
 • Identify core and sub-items
  ➠Contents, objectives, framework conditions

###  Methodology: How?
 • Desging rough structure
 • Finding methods and exercises
 • Develop a teaching scipt
 • Check concept
  ➠Concrete organization of the seminar: Methods, 
learning paths, processes and exercises.

 Lecture: Introduction to the 8 steps

## 1. OPEN TOPIC
### General notes
 • Key question: What could be included?
 • Collect content (e.g. using a mind map)
 • Without restrictions and ratings
 • Take notes
 • Start early!

 Lecture: Step 1- Open the topic- Briefly mention the "Follow up to TtT" format, which is usually offered twice a 
year by the UAG
 Passive:
 * In chat [at Step 1]: Link to the follow-up


## 2. CLARIFY CONDITIONS
 ### DOT formula

 Lecture: Step 2- Clarify conditions- Repeat the 3 T's and address the aspect of "learning objectives"- Explicitly refer to the learning objective matrix for RDM (and mention 
additional links)
 Passive:
 * In Chat [at Step 2]: Links to learning objectives--- Resource for Chat--
learning objectives:- learning objective matrix for RDM:

learning objectives etc.: https://www.uni-bremen.de/informationsportal

## 3. SET PRIORITIES
### What does it take to achieve the goals?
! table here 
• The essentials of the teaching content are filtered out. 

comment: 
 Active:
 Lecture: Step 3- Set priorities

## 4. CORE-AND SUB-POINTS
 ### Concretize priorities
 • What are the central headings?
 • How do the contents belong together in a meaningful way?
 • A maximum of 7 learning-related core points (anchor terms)
 • Sub-points: What is it about?

 comment: 
  Active:
 Lecture: Step 4- Identify main and sub-points- Mention the subject map (or workshop map) as a possible visualization 
method

## 5. DESIGN ROUGH STRUCTURE
 What should the general procedure be?
 • Introduction: Get off to a good 
start both thematically and 
socially
 • Main part: Mix input, reflection, 
interim assessments and exercises
• Conclusion: Initiate learning 
transfer

 Lecture: Step 5- Draft the basic structure

 ## 6. METHODS AND EXERCISES
### Methods and exercises enrich the training
 • They move the activity from the trainer to the learners 
(see also exhaling)
 • They each have specific goals, address different target 
groups and require different amounts of time 
(see DOT formula)
 • They support different social and work forms as well as 
basic forms of learning

 Presentation: Step 6- Create methods and exercises- Discuss criteria and basic forms of learning

 ###  Social and working forms
 • Individual work
 • Partner work
 • Trio
 • Group work
 • Educational talk

 ### Basic forms of learning
 • Analyze
 • Observe
 • Remember
 • Explain
 • Read
 • Ask
 • Organize
 • Solve problems
 • Write
 • Practice
 • Transfer
 • Assume

 ###  Criteria for selection
 • DOT formula
 • Topic
 • Group size
 • Energy in the room
 • Available time
 • Personal teaching style
 --> Can change spontaneously, plan alternatives!

 ## 7. DEVELOP A TEACHING SCRIPT
 ### Important for the implementation
 • Contents (individual steps)
 • Material
 • Time and duration
 • Alternatives
 • Responsibilities
 • …

 ###  Additionally for planning
 • Theme block
 • Learning objectives and 
goals of the individual steps
 • Inhale/exhale
 • Voices chime
 • Remarks
 • …

 Lecture: Step 7- Develop the lesson plan- Repeat the concept of inhaling and exhaling (optionally ask the group)- When looking at the table, mention short, medium, and long (SML) to outline 
alternatives for methods and structure

##  DEVELOPATEACHINGSCRIPT
 ### Example:

 ## 8. CHECK CONCEPT
### Possible key questions
 • Arethegoals really being achieved?
 • Does the project suit the target group?
 • Is there an introduction, main part and conclusion?
 • Is there a thematic and a social introduction?
 • Is the alternation of inhalation and exhalation 
correct?
 • Isthealternation of input, practice, and reflection correct?
 • Is the conclusion crisp and encourages the transfer of learning?
 • Is the timing correct? Where could there be a shortage?
 • Couldlengths occur at certain points in the course?
 • Would I like to take part myself?

 Is there a thematic and a social introduction?
 Is the alternation of inhaling and exhaling correct?
 Is the alternation of input, exercise and reflection correct?
 Is the conclusion crisp and does it encourage learning transfer?
 Is the time approach correct?
 Where could it be tight?
 Could there be length at certain points in the course?
 Would I like to take part myself?
